                                    <p>Users seemed to feel very comfortable with terminology. They easily grouped cards related to building a planner together. They also had an easy time grouping the cards related to signing in quickly.</p>

                                    <p>Most cards were kept, but User 2 made some solid points regarding “About Us” sections - shouldn't the user be able to tell what kind of people you are from your product? This idea led to the about section being in the Footer, rather than in its tradition top spot.</p>

May I have your permission to use your work as an example for students to reach in future classes?"</p>

                                    <p>With more time and resources, I would conduct usability testing on my interactive prototype - probably using Maze. Then, I would continue elevating the fidelity of the screens:</p>
                                    <ul class="mb-0">
                                        <li class="mb-2">I would need to create some branding assets like a logo, color palette, and typography. I would also assemble a styleguide to reference for consistency while apply the branding elements.</li>
                                        <li class="mb-2">I would convert my wireframes to mockups and link them up into a prototype.</li>
                                        <li class="mb-0">I'd also need to explore practical aspects of owning and operating a business that produces a physical product. It would be a good time to seek out some professionals in this realm.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <ul class="mb-0">
                                        <li class="mb-2">Honestly, I learned so much during this project. It was the first time that I had worked through the human-centered design process to create something innovative.</li>
                                        <li class="mb-2">I learned the incredible value of user feedback. I realized that I can have the clearest vision for a product but if users are not ready for that service or functionality, then it's a waste of time. It's okay to pivot!</li>
                                        <li class="mb-0">Rapid prototyping is awesome. I remember feeling like, "UGH! Why do I have to make so many versions of this design on PAPER?!" But, once I saw the valuable feedback I was getting I realized how quickly I could improve my designs - I was hooked! Such a great skill!</li>
